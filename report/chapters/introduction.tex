\section{Introduction}
Music has made a dramatic shift to digital platforms. As a result of streaming platforms' availability and ease of use, Spotify has grown significantly,increasing its user base  from 15 million to 100 million since 2010 \cite{barata2021music}. With over 60,000 tracks are now uploaded to Spotify every day \cite{ingham2021over}, there are no doubts that automating the classification of music into genres or subgenres would be favorable.

Genre is a subset of music classified by a particular style, but a genre can also be guided via culture, business, particular artists, and other musical influences \cite{dannenberg2010style}. Genres can be further divided into subgenres. Examples include Country, Pop, Jazz, Rhythm and Blues, Metal, and Rap. It is evident, though, that music subgenres are discussed in less  exact terms, wherein not all of the traits of the parent genre are always present in a particular "subgenre"; on the other hand, a subgenre may display traits that are not present in its parent \cite{hider2023polyphony}. For instance, some subgenres of Pop are Dance-pop, K-pop, Pop rock, Bubblegum pop, Europop, Latin pop, Country pop, Power pop, and Indie pop.


While there has been a large interest in classification on music into genres, subgenre classification has received attention only in EDM \cite{doi:10.1080/09298215.2020.1761399}, likely due to lack of datasets other than GZTAN \cite{ndou2021music}. The term "Electronic/Dance Music" to refers to a diverse range of music composed using computers and electronic instruments, frequently for dancing purposes \cite{mcleod2001genres}. Metal is another captivating genre that has overlapping musical elements and subjectiveness since fans and critics often disagree on what defines a subgenre, as some bands can fit into multiple categories \cite{weinstein2000heavy}. Hence, this paper, aims to find how accurate machine learning classifiers are within metal subgenres. Additionally, it can be asked if there is any significant confusion among subgenres over multiple classifiers.
